# ApplePie

ApplePie is a class project from my CIS 215 course. Students were tasked with building a small game that made use of several concepts learned in class:

<ul>
<li>Arrays are used to populate UI data.</li>
<li>Custom functions are used.</li>
<li>UI objects are oganized into stacks or have dynamic constraints.</li>
<li>UI data is dynamic/not hardcoded.</li>
<li>Game displays score/results.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Summary</h3>
In ApplePie, the user plays a very familiar classic: Hangman. It's called ApplePie because instead of a morbid stick figure set to hang, the user plays with apples on a tree. If they guess wrong, they lose an apple ad have fewer to harvest for apple pie. In this project, I made use of an array, computed variables, and custom functions to make this functionality possible.

<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<ul>
<li>How to effectively apply feedback from UX testing.</li>
<li>How important it is to have dynamic alignment.</li>
<li>How to tie custom functions to a button.</li>
<li>How to display computed values using variables.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I'd Do Differently</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use SwiftUI instead of Storyboard</li>
<li>Animate the tree to show a falling apple motion.</li>
<li>Add more complex words for the user to guess.</li>
<li>Design an iOS version.</li>
<li>Add a custom font.</li>
<li>Use a more appealing color/design scheme.</li>
</ul>
